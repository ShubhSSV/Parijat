                <p><strong>Benefits:</strong> The Parijat plant, also known as Nyctanthes arbor-tristis or the Night-flowering Jasmine, is widely recognized for its medicinal and health benefits. In traditional Ayurvedic medicine, Parijat leaves, flowers, and seeds are used to treat a variety of ailments. The leaves are commonly utilized for their anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties, aiding in the relief of arthritis pain and muscle stiffness. Parijat flowers are known to help alleviate anxiety and promote restful sleep. Additionally, the plant's extracts have been shown to boost immunity, support digestion, and combat skin conditions due to their antioxidant and antimicrobial properties.

                <p><strong>Season:</strong> Parijat plants bloom predominantly in the post-monsoon season, especially from late summer through autumn (August to October). During this period, the plant produces clusters of fragrant white flowers with an orange-red center, which are often observed blossoming at night and falling off by morning. The plant thrives best in tropical and subtropical climates, making it particularly suited for regions with warm temperatures and moderate humidity. Although it can flower sporadically at other times, the bloom is most prolific in the post-monsoon season when the soil is moist, enhancing the plantâ€™s growth and flower production.</p>

                <p><strong>Region:</strong> Parijat is native to South Asia and is especially prevalent in countries like India, Nepal, Thailand, and parts of Southeast Asia. In India, it grows abundantly in states like Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, and Assam. It is also cultivated widely across the Indian subcontinent in tropical and subtropical regions due to its resilience and adaptability. The plant is revered in Indian culture, often associated with religious rituals and mythology. In addition to its native regions, Parijat is now grown as an ornamental and medicinal plant in gardens around the world, where the climate permits.</p>

                <p><strong>Age:</strong> Parijat plants have a moderately long lifespan, typically ranging from 10 to 15 years, depending on the care and growing conditions. With proper maintenance, including adequate sunlight, watering, and occasional pruning, the plant can flourish for many years and continue to produce flowers annually. Mature Parijat plants can reach a height of 2-3 meters (6-10 feet) and start flowering as early as one to two years after planting. The age of the plant also influences the richness of its blossoms and the potency of its medicinal properties, making mature plants especially valued in traditional medicine practices.</p>
